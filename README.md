# Static-System-Java-Library
This is just a simple Java Library that will allow you to use the System methods in a static way.

Example:
Now normally you would say System.out.println() to print to the console. With this library added to a project and imported into a class,
you would only need to say out.Println()

Instructions:
1. Download the library
2. Add it to your project
3. On the class you want to use it on add this line of code to the "imports":
import sSystem.sSystem.*;
4. You are all set.
